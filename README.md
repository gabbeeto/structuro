# structuro
I've done this so I can structure my codebase so much better.

input files: are the files I work with to make the page works, and webpack converts it into one file that's going to be on the 'output' folder

index.html:
it contains to contain the boilerplate for the page

structure.js:
it contains all the node variables that is made by the user.

node.js from nodes folder:
it contains the node hierarchy for the entire structure of nodes.


createNodes.js and removeNodes.js and editNodes.js from nodes folder:
it contains the functions related to the buttons that create/remove/edit nodes.

import.js and export.js from structure folder:
it contains the functions related to importing/exporting the structure  


displayNodes.js:
it displays the nodes in the html files

buttons.js:
add events to all the buttons from html and apply the functionality from the createNodes.js/removeNodes.js/editNodes.js/import.js/export.js/displayNodes.js
